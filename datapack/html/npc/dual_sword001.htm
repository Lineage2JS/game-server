It is only natural that in order to create a dual sword, you'd need the two swords which are being combined.
<br>
Of course, I charge a small fee since I'm not working for charity and all. And heating costs for stoking the fire are pretty steep...
<br>
As you may know, it's not easy to handle the sword unless the balance between both hands is equal. This means that only swords of identical grades can be combined... And keep in mind that enchanted weapons lose their effect once they are combined with another sword.
<br>
Am I worrying for nothing? I'm sure you know all of this. Now choose which sword to forge!!
